### Reaction Equilibirum Assumption (REA):
The following code aims to demonstrate the use of the reaction equilibirum assumption (REA) by applying it
to a series reaction taking place inside a batch reactor : (A <-> B <-> C) 
This is an assumption often used to 
simpliy reaction models. In the case of the above series reaction if k2, k-2 >> k1, k-1  meaning that 
the second reaction is fast enough to equilibrate  immediately after any displacement from its equilibirum condition, 
than the full reaction model can be simplified on the basis that rate of the second reaction B <-> C is equal to 0.
